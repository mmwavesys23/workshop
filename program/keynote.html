<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Keynote 1: From RF-based Sensing to RF Computing &ndash; Unremitting Exploration about RF Signals</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Abstract: </u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing and communication are primary tasks of an IoT system, where RF signals play increasingly important roles. The first half of this talk will briefly review the development of the RF-based sensing technology, which utilizes RF signals as information carrier. The second half of this talk will introduce our recent two works on backscatter and ISAC (integrated sensing and communication). Taking them as examples, we want to share our vision of RF Computing, which exploit RF signals as the objects of computing in future IoT systems. We will also discuss the research space in this direction.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Keynote 2: AI Guardians - Harnessing the Power of Radar Technology for Enhanced Health Monitoring in Geriatric Care</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Abstract: </u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, and diabetes are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. These conditions necessitate continuous patient monitoring to detect potential health deterioration and prevent future complications. Vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels are crucial indicators in the detection, diagnosis, and management of these diseases. However, existing technologies may not be suitable for all patients and suffer from a plurality of deployment challenges. Recognizing the need for autonomous vital sign monitoring systems, particularly in the context of pandemics and remote healthcare, we have developed a suite of non-invasive radio-based sensors powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These sensors are designed for monitoring of health-related modalities, including vital signs, sleep apnea, respiratory diseases, gait, blood pressure, and glucose monitoring. In this presentation, I will review some of our earlier works using different RF and mm-Wave radar platforms, including the Google Soli platform. I will then delve into the process of our system development, as well as the validation campaigns of the performance of various developed sensors, alongside multiple demonstrations of the functionality of these devices in realistic environments, including hospitals and long-term care homes. Furthermore, I will discuss our ongoing and planned developments in the RF/mm-Wave and sub-THz radar technology, aimed at enabling a variety of future AI-powered health-monitoring cognitive platforms.  </p>
